Python Prediction

I am trying to make the AI model try to predict the score of a student with a specific amount of sleeping hours will get on a test. Using my piror skills, it helps me create a deeper understanding on how essential data is when training a model in order for it to complete something quickly yet still accurately. 

My project needed python code and good and organized data for it to learn to form a good answer. 

This project needed the help of an AI model that needed data to learn from and base its answer from. 

At the end of my project, it created a short and accurate prediction of how much a student scored on a test depending on the amount of hours they had slept and amount of hours studies the night prior.

One important thing you learned from this project.
The most helpeful and important thing I learned from this project was how impportant data is when training and AI model and how the more it has, the more accurate answer the model will create. With this knowledge, it will help me with future AI model trainig and the creating of data that is used in the models.
